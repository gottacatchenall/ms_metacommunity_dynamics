MetacommunityDynamics.jl Manuscript -- outline

# Introduction

- What is a metacommunity?
- Why do we need software to simulate metacommunities?
- What can other people do with this software?
- What does the rest of this paper look like?


# Methods

## Outline of theoretical framework used to represent metacommunity dynamics

- Metacommunity paradigms (Species Sorting, Mass-Effect, Neutral, Patch Dynamics)
- Velland 2010 --- fundemental mechanisms (dispersal, speciation, selection, drift)


## Outline of software structure

### The species pool and the metaweb

### Landscape and dispersal structure

### The Metacommunity Tensor

- Abstract dynamics model / difference map
- space/time/species axes


# Results

Use-case examples.

1. Co-evolution of plant-pollinator interaction netowrks
2. Occupancy of food-webs in a landscape
3. Invasive vs. native plant in a landscape
4. How does landscape structure effect species richness?
5. Disease spillover interaction networks


# Discussion

What next for the software?

- parameter estimation from data
- scalable/parallelizable

How can this be applied by others
